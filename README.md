## Usage

**Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version v14.x or above.**

2. Delete old `.env`, rename `.env.schema` to `.env` and fill out the values (example on .env.example)
3. Install dependencies as stated [here](https://github.com/zhycorp/disc-11#Installation) before you continue surfing
4. Run `npm run build`, or `yarn run build` if you're using Yarn package manager
